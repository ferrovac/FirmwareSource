# FirmwareSource
Source code for all LSC based devices.
To make the creation of firmware more approachable we decided to use an Arduino DUE as controller. If you want do modify an existing firmware or write your own, you will need to download the Arduino IDE. Once the IDE is installed download our [LSC library](https://github.com/ferrovac/libraries) and place it in the Arduino folder. We are currently working on a tutorial to help you get started. Stay tuned for updates!
